                        <p>First Century Monopoly is similar to the popular board game after which it was named.
                            It consists of 2 to 4 players that roll a dice in order to travel around the game board.
                            There are various types of places a player can visit as they play.
                            Each player starts off 3 with three Scrolls that they can use throughout the game.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cities are color coded and are places players can visit. 
                                If they are the first to land on a city, they can start a congregation there.</li>
                            <li>Synagogues are similar, each one visited by a player may be used to start 
                                a congregation for the cost of one scroll.</li>
                            <li>Players can land on cells labelled 'Time and unforeseen occurrences' or 'Letters from the governing body'. In each case players will receive instructions to follow to 
                                respond to unexpected events, both positive and negative.</li>
                            <li>Players may also land on the 1 scroll tax position which will cost them one scroll.</li>
                            <li>Landing on or passing the Go position will result in the player earning an additional scroll</li>
                            <li>A player may land on the 'Go to Jail' position. If they do, they will be moved to the jail position for 3 turns.
                                During this time, the player may not move or start any congregations. </li>
                            <li>If a player lands on a congregation started by another player, they may be prompted to answer 
                                a question in order to earn more scrolls.</li>
                            <li>The game ends when 1 player crosses Go 3 times. The winner is determined as the player with the most 
                                congregations started by the time the game ends.</li>
                        </ul>
